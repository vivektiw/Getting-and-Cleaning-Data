Source dataset https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip.

*  You should create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following.
*  Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
*  Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
*  Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
*  Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive activity names.
*  Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

## Notes

*  Only vaiables containing mean() & std() are used.
*  Requires the plyr & reshape2 packages.
*  Assumes the dataset is unzipped in the current directory.
*  

## Dependencies
run_analysis.R file will help you to install the dependencies automatically. It depends on reshape2 and data.table.

About the script and the tidy dataset
-------------------------------------
I created a script called run_analysis.R which will merge the test and training sets together.
Prerequisites for this script:

1. the UCI HAR Dataset must be extracted and..
2. the UCI HAR Dataset must be availble in a directory called "UCI HAR Dataset"

After merging testing and training, labels are added and only columns that have to do with mean and standard deviation are kept.

Lastly, the script will create a tidy data set containing the means of all the columns per test subject and per activity.
This tidy dataset will be written to a tab-delimited file called tidy.txt, which can also be found in this repository.

About the Code Book
-------------------
The CodeBook.md file explains the transformations performed and the resulting data and variables.

##  Running

```bash
$ Rscript run_analysis.R
```

Yields tidy.txt & tidy.mean.txt.
